# DynamicalFrictionIntegrator
compute orbits of objects in potential distributions including dynamical friction

**Integrators**
Calculate the orbits of a body inside different density distributions: Plummer (globular cluster), Hernquist (stellar galactic component) and NFW (dark matter halo)
considers especially the drag from dynamical friction that the body experiences via a semianalytic treatment following Chandrasekhars formalism

**evaluation**
Plots some interesting parameters of the system
